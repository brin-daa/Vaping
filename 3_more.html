    <div class="textbox top-left">How to start? Here are five points you can follow to start your journey!</div>

    <div class="textbox middle-left">1. Set a Quit Date and Make a Plan:<br>
In two weeks, set a date to quit vaping. Describe your reasons for <br>quitting and create a plan. Incorporate craving and withdrawal <br>management.<br><br>

2. Avoid Vaping Triggers:<br>
Identify specific situations and environments where you usually vape.<br> For instance, if you vape while driving, change your routine by<br> listening to audiobooks or podcasts to keep your mind occupied. <br><br>

3. Create a Support Network:<br>
Ask a trusted friend or family member to be your “quit buddy.” <br>Regularly check in with them, especially during tough moments, <br>to share your progress and get encouragement. You can also join <br>online forums or social media groups dedicated to quitting vaping.<br><br>

4. Substitute Hand-to-Mouth Habit:<br>
Replace the physical habit of vaping with another activity that keeps <br>your hands busy. Try activities like knitting, drawing, or using a stress <br>ball. Having physical activity can help distract you from the urge to vape.<br><br>

5. Track Your Progress:<br>
Use a quitting app such as Smokeless or QuitSure to monitor your <br>progress. These apps can track how many days you’ve been vape-free, <br>how much money you’ve saved, and the health benefits you’re<br> experiencing. Seeing tangible progress can boost your motivation.<br><br>
